The course is structured in four days, each of which have 3h of theory and practice. Each day introduces to various topics:

- [Day 1](01_introduction): Introduction to sensing
- [Day 2](02_datalogging): Making an actual sensor setup
- [Day 3](03_dsp): Making sense of data
- [Day 4](04_computer_vision): Introduction to Computer Vision

In each folder, you can find the presentation slides, as well as examples seen during the classes and more material and references.
