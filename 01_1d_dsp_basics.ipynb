    "> Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Convolution is a DSP technique used in many fields, from 1-d signal analysis to more advanced image processing and video analysis in deep learning algorithms (CNN = Convolutional Neural Networks). It is very important to be familiar with it and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [DSP Guide](https://www.dspguide.com/ch6/4.htm):\n",
    "> Convolution is a formal mathematical operation, just as multiplication, addition, and integration. Addition takes two numbers and produces a third number, while convolution takes two signals and produces a third signal. Convolution is used in the mathematics of many fields, such as probability and statistics. In linear systems, convolution is used to describe the relationship between three signals of interest: the input signal, the impulse response, and the output signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.dspguide.com/graphics/F_6_8.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Figure 6-8 illustrates (...) a flow diagram of how convolution occurs. Think of the input signal, x[n], and the output signal, y[n], as fixed on the page. The convolution machine, everything inside the dashed box, is free to move left and right as needed. The convolution machine is positioned so that its output is aligned with the output sample being calculated. Four samples from the input signal fall into the inputs of the convolution machine. These values are multiplied by the indicated samples in the impulse response, and the products are added. This produces the value for the output signal, which drops into its proper place. For example, y[n] is shown being calculated from the four input samples: x[3], x[4], x[5], and x[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "> To calculate y[7], the convolution machine moves one sample to the right. This results in another four samples entering the machine, x[4] through x[7], and the value for y[7] dropping into the proper place. This process is repeated for all points in the output signal needing to be calculated."

    "This same dilemma arises in (d), where the convolution machine tries to accept samples to the right of the defined input signal, points x[9], x[10] and x[11].\n",
    "\n",
    "> One way to handle this problem is by **inventing the nonexistent samples**. This involves adding samples to the ends of the input signal, with each of the added samples having a value of zero. This is called **padding** the signal with zeros. Instead of trying to access a nonexistent value, the convolution machine receives a sample that has a value of zero. Since this zero is eliminated during the multiplication, the result is mathematically the same as ignoring the nonexistent inputs."

    "\n",
    "- Always try to remove the noise from the signal before doing anything else in it\n",
    "- Be careful with numerical problems - small numbers are not handled well numerically\n",
    "- Use filters with caution, try different options before going for a final selection of parameters\n",
    "- There is no general set of parameters for everything\n",
    "- Do not try to find a solution that suits you, but that suits your problem. Quick solutions are often not extrapolated out of laboratory conditions\n",
